# Reverse Polish notation calculator

Command-line based RPN calculator

- The calculator waits for user input and expects to receive strings containing whitespace separated lists of numbers and operators.

- Numbers are pushed on to the stack.  Operators operate on numbers that are on the stack.

- Available operators are `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `sqrt`, `undo`, `clear`

- Operators pop their parameters off the stack, and push their results back onto the stack.

- The `clear` operator removes all items from the stack.
- The `undo` operator undoes the previous operation.  "undo undo" will undo the previous two operations.
- `sqrt` performs a square root on the top item from the stack
- The `+`, `-`, `*`, `/` operators perform addition, subtraction, multiplication and division respectively on the top two items from the stack.

- After processing an input string, the calculator displays the current contents of the stack as a space-separated list. 
- Numbers are stored on the stack to at least 15 decimal places of precision, but displayed to 10 decimal places (or less if it causes no loss of precision).

- If an operator cannot find a sufficient number of parameters on the stack, a warning is displayed:

  `operator <operator> (position: <pos>): insufficient parameters`

- After displaying the warning, all further processing of the string terminates and the current state of the stack is displayed.

## Examples

```markdown
Example 1
------------------
5 2

stack: 5 2


Example 2
------------------
2 sqrt

stack: 1.4142135623

clear 9 sqrt

stack: 3


Example 3
------------------
5 2 -

stack: 3

3 -

stack: 0

clear

stack:


Example 4
------------------
5 4 3 2

stack: 5 4 3 2

undo undo *

stack: 20 5 *

stack: 100

undo

stack: 20 5


Example 5
------------------
7 12 2 /

stack: 7 6 *

stack: 42 4/

stack: 10.5


Example 6
------------------
1 2 3 4 5

stack: 1 2 3 4 5

*

stack: 1 2 3 20

clear 3 4 -

stack: -1

Example 7
------------------
1 2 3 4 5

stack: 1 2 3 4 5

* * * *

stack: 120


Example 8
------------------
1 2 3 * 5 + * * 6 5

operator * (position: 8): insufficient parameters

stack: 11

(the 6 and 5 were not pushed on to the stack due to the previous error)
